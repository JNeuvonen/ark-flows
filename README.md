ARK ETF is the biggest publicly traded actively managed ETF fund. ETF funds have to disclose their positions before every trading day. This presents a fun opportunity for visualizing ARK's position changes from day to day and their longer term strategy.

How to use the APP?

You can either select ARK's fund from the top left corner, or search for a company ARK holds, like Tesla for example.
